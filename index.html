      <h2> Starting Regions &quot; Hear, Feel, Think. &quot;</h2>
      <p> The following regions are the three locations you may begin your journey as an adventurer. Here is where it all starts. Where you hear, feel, and think.</p>
      <h3> La Noscea</h3>
      <p> Limsa Lominsa -the capital of La Noscea- is a major port city of the continent of Eorzea, located on the island of Vlybrand. Not much of note happens here. Some fishing, some cooking, some mild theivery. At least... I don't <em> think</em> much else happens here. </p>
      <p> The leader of Limsa is an ex-pirate, Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn. </p>

      <h3> The Black Shroud (aka the Twelveswood) </h3>
      <p> Gridania -the capital of The Black Shroud- is a center for the study of more naturalistic magics, such as conjury. </p>
         <p>The leader of Gridania is a padjal, named Kan-E-Senna. </p>

      <h3> Thanalan</h3>
      <p> Ul'Dah -the capital of Thanalan- is where the story of Johennes began. A young gladiator began her adventure here. This commercial powerhouse lives and dies by free-market capitalism and monarchy, two rather embarassing facts. But facts, they are. </p>
         <p>Nanamo-Ul-Namo rules this city as sultana, with her right hand man, Raubahn.</p>
         <p>Though she does not believe in the monarchy she benefits from, she is doing her best to keep the greed of the monetarists in check, for the sake of her city and her people.
         She takes her power very seriously. </p>

      <h2> Additional ARR Regions &quot; Master Louisoix... I understand now...the choice you made... In death...there is life... Farewell, Urianger...you daft old coot... &quot;</h2>
      <h3> Coerthas (Central Highlands) </h3>
      <p> In this cold zone, we meet the houses of Ishgard, and some members of such houses. The most notable of which is Lord Haurchefant Greystone, of House Fortemps. </p>
      <p>We are also first introduced to the more insular faction of Ishgard proper and their main struggle against the dragons. A war that has been waging from millenia, The Dragonsong War.
      </p>
      
      <h3> Mor Dhona</h3> 
      <p>This small city situated mostly in between the three starting regions, and adjacent to the central highlands, is both a commercial hub and <s>the headquarters for the Scions of the Seventh Dawn.</s></p>
      <p>Mor Dhona has been overtaken just as the faction known as the Crystal Braves was overtaken by the Ul-Dahn monetarists.</p>

      <h2> Heavensward Regions &quot; DYS AN SOHM IN &quot; (Our slumber disturbed) </h2>
      <h3> Coerthas (After Central Highlands)</h3>
      <p>Ishgard -capital of Coerthas- is home to tradition, heirarchy, and a frothing disdane for dragons. With the gates only recently opened, those willing may help in the climactic Dragonsong War.</p>
